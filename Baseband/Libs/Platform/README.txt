Platform incompatible.
=================================================================

	Module "platform" provides the functions and macros that
support W90N740 as the baseband.
	To make a porting, functions and macros supported by baseband may be replaced with the new porting. Other code not
included in "Platform" need not be changed if possible.

=================================================================

Release note:
	Nov 22 2004:
		Define alias name for functions in "SysLib".
		Define W99702 registers mapping address.
